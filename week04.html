- [Blender tutorials from its webpage](https://www.blender.org/support/tutorials/)  

- [Blender for 3D Printing tutorial](https://cloud.blender.org/p/3d-printing/)

	Tutorial about:  
	Blender has supported 3D printing modeling and file formats since 2002. However, from Blender version 2.67 (* Now it's 2.77a in September 2016) this now is even more accessible and powerful, thanks to the 3D Printing Toolbox and real-time Mesh Analysis features.

	This Training Tutorial is for everyone who is into 3D printing, beginners and professionals alike. There are extensive chapters introducing Blender modeling for new users, and then going on to cover everything you need to know to create efficient, high-quality 3D prints â€“ including color, wall thickness, and overhang problems. You will also find printable models to experiment with yourself.

	Whether you own your own 3D printer, or use online services such as ShapeWays, this 3+-hour training tutorial will help you join in this exciting new maker era!
