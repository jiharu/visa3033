## How to make the biggest 3D prints from the smallest 3D printers
Every 3D printer has a limited build volume, defined by the bounding box in which the part has to fit.

# Case study
- [Doug Bucci](http://www.dougbucci.com/index.php/portfolio/category/1-islet)  
The literal definition of Diabetes Mellitus is “siphon honey”, which inspired me to use the hexagonal “honeycomb” to represent a cell shape, a pure and mathematically sound structure for generating form. The honeycomb cells were manipulated via Computer Aided Design (CAD) to generate more complex structures. This transformation of microscopic cellular structure into tangible form has evolved into the Islet Series, which integrates real biologically inspired data into jewelry form via CAD.

The collaborators' innovative designs combine precisely detailed polymer, crystal and leather components into interlinking three-dimensional fabric structures with striking qualities of flexibility, sparkle and transparency.

# Practice
- Practice A: Creating 3 * 3 chain-mail block in Maya  
- Practice B: Creating chain-mail in Blender
- Practice C: Booleans operations  
- Practice D: 3D Text in Maya

-----------------------------------------
## Practice A: 3 * 3 chain-mail block in Maya 

- Create a torus: Create / Polygon Primitives / Torus 
	- R (Radius): 3.5  
	- r (Section Radius): 0.5   
	- Axis division: 40    
	- Height division: 20  
	
	![chainmail_m01](img/maya01.png) 
	
- Duplicate the torus in the X and Z directions
	- Using Edit / Duplicate Special 
	
	![chainmail_m02_01](img/maya02_01.png)
	![chainmail_m02](img/maya02.png)   
	
- Duplicate the torus in the Y direction
	- Using Edit / Duplicate Special 
	- Duplicate missing bridges manually to complete  
	
	![chainmail_m03](img/maya03.png) 
	
- Create your own set by changing the parameter values, proportions, or scales.	

	![chainmail_m04](img/maya04.png) 
	
- Choose the object and save it as .obj file.  
	- If you can't find obj file format, you can load it from Windows / Settings / Preferences / Plug-in Manager /

## Practice B: chain-mail in Blender
- [How to Design and 3D Print Chainmail Patterns and Interlocking Parts using Blender by Roxy](https://i.materialise.com/blog/how-to-design-and-3d-print-chainmail-and-other-interlocking-parts/)  
	- Note that it is an old version of Blender, however the commands and how they work remain the same.   
	- Blender tutorials:
		- [Tutorials from Blender webpage](https://www.blender.org/support/tutorials/)  
		- [Blender for 3D Printing tutorial](https://cloud.blender.org/p/3d-printing/):   
		Blender has supported 3D printing modeling and file formats since 2002. From version 2.67 (* Now it's 2.77a in September 2016) Blender supports a 3D Printing Toolbox and real-time Mesh Analysis features.

---------------------------------------------

## Boolean operations
Three boolean operations let you combine objects to make shapes that would otherwise be difficult to model using other techniques. You can add, subtract, or intersect objects to create a new, complex shape. [Examples](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU/?guid=GUID-7DADD144-6C29-4AE3-B877-A9947B2F26E0)

### Examples of Boolean processing
![boo01](img/bl01.png) 

### Different kinds of boolean operation 
![boo01](img/bl02.png)  

## Practice C: Boolean operations
	
- In Maya, polygons
	1. Create more than 2 polygon objects.
	2. Choose model 1 and model 2.
	4. Click Boolean operation from Modeling menu set -> Mesh / Booleans / select among 'Union, Difference, and Intersection'. 

---------------------------------------
## Practice D: 3D Text in Maya  
- in Maya: **Create / Text**

<!--![bb01](img/bb.png) -->
![bb02](img/bb01.png)
![bb03](img/bb02.png)
![bb04](img/bb03.png) 

----------------------------------------
	
## Assignment
- Complete today's class works and upload your final and unique customized chain mail screenshot(s) to Tumblr and its modeling data to the google drive. 
	- Consider factors for fabrication: size, stability, strength..
	- Please name your file with your name and date. Caption to Tumblr is: "a04 by your name and date".   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mid-term project consideration  
- **Mid-term project (individual): An arts research presentation at 6th week + first print + modeling data.**     
	- An arts research presentation: develop your own preferences and artistic direction regarding 3D fabrication.
	- Presentation format 
		- Length: Presentation needs to be done in 3 mins so around 3~5 pages including the front title page will be good.
		- What it needs to include: 
			- your research about an inspiring 3D fabrication artwork and artist.  
			- Keywords to show your object and subject direction in 3d fabrication.  
			- your sketch to show your concept 
			- your brief plan to achieve your goal
			- any kind of collaboration you expect to do
	- First 3D printing and its modeling data: applying the chainmail structure, build your 3D modeling and print it at approximately 2 inch (5 cm) size.
