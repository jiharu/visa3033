# Personal 3D printing
## Shapeways

- [Shapeways 3D Printing & the Culture of Creativity, 2012 [2:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJuTM0Y7U1k)

>Shapeways is simultaneously a manufacturing service and a marketplace. In the digital platform, users can upload designs, order 3D-printed objects, and set up shops. A constellation of independent designers takes advantage of the company’s manufacturing and customer service capabilities that serve thousands of online designer shops hosted in the platform. Buyers can also customize the shape and size of products at the moment of purchase and have them manufactured on demand. Fuelled by 3D printing, Shapeways’ “Made in the Future” stands for on-demand manufacturing, zero inventory, customization, and design flexibility.

# Copyright and customization
Reference: Printing Things, gestalten, 2014.  
## Authorship, originality, and property problems in 3D printing
- More and more people are using borrowed elements to create new models, which can cause infringements on third-party intellectual property rights. This happens due to:
	- Increasing democratization of manufacturing.
	- Influx of consumers turning to casual product designs. 
- The situation is similar to the invention of the printing press, the widespread affordability of cameras, the advent of MP3 file formats and other forms of online file sharing. 

## Two cases
### Low poly Final Fantasy VII models by Joaquin Baldwin (director and 3D animator)
- In July 2013, Joaquin Baldwin, a Walt Disney Animation Studio digital cinematographer, sent low polygon 3D models taken from Final Fantasy VII to Shapeways which didn't exist at the time. Shapeways offers not only a print service but artists the option to sell their designs in an online store so that the company can print and ship orders on demand.

- [Who wants 3D printed Final Fantasy VII figures? ME! Aug 16](https://www.destructoid.com/who-wants-3d-printed-final-fantasy-vii-figures-me--260141.phtml)  
- [Print chop: How copyright killed a 3D-printed Final Fantasy fad, Aug 16](https://www.cnet.com/news/print-chop-how-copyright-killed-a-3d-printed-final-fantasy-fad/) 
	- "The entire episode, which lasted barely more than a month, is a fine example of the potential complexities involved in the burgeoning realm of 3D printing. In this case, consumers were eager to buy a product one fan had created that happened to be physically printed and offered for sale by a separate company -- all of whom were then affected by the copyright owner bringing down the hammer.  
	Though copyright laws and 3D printing have certainly butted heads before, the dropping costs of printing, and the number of artists eager to use the method as a medium for both original and borrowed creations, will undoubtedly continue to force the issue."

### Strandbeests ("beach animals") by Dutch kinetic artist Theo Jansen

- TED [
Theo Jansen: My creations, a new form of life](https://www.ted.com/talks/theo_jansen_creates_new_creatures?language=en)  
- [Strandbeest](http://www.strandbeest.com/)
- Fans -Bo Hansen and Tim van Bentum- were rebuilding them, behind his back, in various forms using DIY techniques.
- They approach Theo Jansen with the idea of developing miniature 3D-printed offspring of his Strandbeests. 
- The three now jointly develop a range of 3D-printed Strandbeests, which are sold in Theo Jansen's shop at Shapeways: it became one of the best-selling and most interesting objects available through the service.

---------------------------
# Practice
1. Sketch a 3D model: simple but beautiful and stable for 3D printing.  
2. Create a 3D model: you can use Meshmixer, shapeshifter, or any software you prefer. 
3. Analyze and fix the model using **Meshmixer / Inspector**
	When you click Inspector, you'll see your model with a number of spheres attached to it:
	- Blue spheres represent holes.
	- Red spheres represent non-manifold areas.
	- Magenta spheres represent disconnected components. 
>- Left clicking on a sphere will repair the problem.  
>- Right clicking on the sphere will select the area and allow you to edit that part of the mesh. 

4. Upload your model to Shapeways
	- Create your account
	- Your 3D model goes through automated printability checks and you get instant pricing in 40+ high-quality materials.  
	
5. If you fail, let's use **Meshmixer / Print** to directly export to Shapeways. 	

6. Extra: try to use custom apps linked from Shapeways	

----------------------------------------	
## Assignment
- Due date is **Monday Oct 3rd midnight**. If you upload all the assignments by this date, there will be no late penalty.
- Review the class material.  
- Once you complete your upload to Shapeways, share a screenshot through Tumblr. Please clarify the making process -- which program you used, how you made the form -- in the comments for your screenshot on Tumblr. Please include "a03 by your name and date".  
- Upload your draft sketch for the **mid-term** preparation (6th week) (1-2 pages) to Tumblr, showing your interest, keyword, and direction.   
	
- If you are willing to share your mesh data, upload it to this [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7x8GrEkHm-LVFJraWpHaE9MX2M?usp=sharing). Create a folder, with your name, to upload it to.
