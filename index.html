Spatial dynamics is an art studio class which explores objects in space, and spaces of objects, in terms of formations based on function, structure, and temporal relations. Students will learn through lectures, hands-on practice, and group critique, developing an understanding of material capacities and core principles in the construction of form and space. Working as individuals or in groups, while taking an interdisciplinary stance bridging roles of artist, designer, and engineer, students will define theoretical and creative challenges found in art and nature to produce three-dimensional spatial exploration integrating object and space, time and space, form and function.

Students will learn, practice, and express:

- To build a framework of skills and knowledge, an understanding of processes, and terminology of spatial formation methods and materials.  
- To increase artistic senses through practice experience and experimentation.  
- To articulate ideas and develop artistic problem-solving methods of interdisciplinary research, and by incremental refinement find the challenges and possibilities inherent in the construction process of a given material.  
- To understand and express spatial dynamics in variety contexts such as space & object, space & time (processes and scale), form & function (force), and nature & culture.  
- To explore independent artistic expression through experimentation.  
- To gain awareness of contemporary art issues through various examples.

## Prerequisites 

None.

## Course format

In order to cultivate critical thinking and creative innovation related to artistic problem-solving processes, the class format is consisted with lectures, demonstrations, group critiques, student presentations, and most importantly, hands-on practice:

- Class time is devoted to studio work along with lectures and demonstrations by the instructor, group or individual critiques, and occasional student presentations.  
- Lecture presentations throughout the term introduce students to examples of artworks and artists working with materials, construction techniques, issues and themes relevant to the assigned projects and to contemporary art practice.  
- Demonstrations focus on construction processes and materials relevant to the projects and provide information on structural integrity and effective craftsmanship.  
- Individual or group critiques along with ongoing instructor feedback provide a context for analysis and discussion.  
- Occasional student presentations will help to differentiate and elaborate their artistic interests and to inspire each other’s further growth.  
- Hands-on practices are the essential means by which students will investigate spatial formation problem solving abilities.  

Periodically there will be in class work periods, but it is expected that the majority of the assignments will be completed outside of class time.  
Students will build their work progress portfolio throughout the class.

## Evaluation

1) Mid-term: Constructing rectilinear volumes 30%   
2) Final-term: Installation of biomorphic form 40%  
3) Work portfolio and presentation: records of ongoing progress, practices, and a final result. 20%  
4) Class and critique participation, 10%   

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evaluation/Grading Criteria:  
- Engagement of the student in their research studies, as well as their curiosity and motivation to learn and achieve.  
- Quality of the work produced, including the student’s sensitivity to materials, originality (responding your identity, philosophy, and world), and novelty (which shows your understanding of the field).  
- Creativity and concept development: skills applied to problem solving processes.  
- Ability to handle materials and understand process.  
- Commitment (includes attendance, participation, completing work on time, ambitiousness of project).   
- Work habits: planning, preparation, follow through, timely completion of work. 
￼

## Course policies

1) Using the art studio; there will be strict rules for using the art studio for safety and public usability, which will be announced during the first week of the semester.  
2) Attendance rule; this class will follow the general Sogang attendance rule, if you are not sure please check it on the Sogang website or from the class TA.  
3) Support for the disabled: seat support/ Extensions on homework’s and project submissions/ TA support etc.

## Materials and References

Class website: http://jiharu.github.io/2016ant2016/ 

Material List  

- Work clothes
- Paper cutting knife and extra blades  
- Cutting mat  
- Metal ruler minimum 12”  
- Sketchbook, pencils etc  
- More will be announced in the class  

If we use a laser-cutter or a 3D printer, students need to follow strict protocols which will be announced later.
