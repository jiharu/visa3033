## Related classes next semester

- FA/VISA 3034 3.0 Digital Fabrication 
 
	Introduces students to the possibilities for translating digital objects into physical objects using three-dimensional printing technologies, and related conceptual concerns. Compulsory Material Fees apply. 
	Prerequisite: 3 credits from the 2030 series of courses. Crosslisted to FA/DATT 3941 3.00

	Section Director: Brandon Vickerd
	Day: W, Start Time: 8:30, Duration: 240, Location: CFA 004.		

- FA/DATT 4940 3.0  Generative and Parametric 3D Modeling for the Arts

	Course Description:

	Explores the techniques of generative and parametric 3D modeling through the use of scripting and programming interfaces to professional grade render-time 3D modeling software tools such as Rhinoceros/Grasshopper, Maya, Solid Works, and Blender, and real-time 3D graphics tools and software such as Max, Processing, and software libraries such as OpenFrameworks, and Cinder which incorporate OpenGL and GLSL Shading Languages. These tools represent two domains, where one domain is geared toward the development of fixed content and 3D fabrication; the other is primarily virtual and interactive. A generative and parametric 3D modeling approach facilitates the integration of these two domains, whereby there is a real-time, interactive approach to the development of spatial content. Because the techniques presented in this course have wide implications, concepts and approaches will draw from fields of architecture, industrial design, art making, and other fields where computational methods are use to create 3D objects and forms. Prerequisites: FA/DATT 3940 or FA/VISA 3033 or FA/DATT 2500

	Section Director: Mark-David Hosale   
	Day: W,	Start Time: 14:30,	Duration: 240, Location: ACW  103.

# Final submission

### Due date:
- Dec 12th Monday midnight.

### Where to submit:
- Portfolio [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7x8GrEkHm-LWGJUeHFWVWUxMms?usp=sharing).  

- Final presentation [Final-term presentation Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7x8GrEkHm-LXzI4OGtkd3k4Z1U?usp=sharing). Name your pdf as "yourGroupProjectTitle" before class begins.

You can add photo images of your physical print to both the final presentation file as well as to your portfolio documentation.

Please check the details about submission requirements from the previous class notes. If you have any questions, please email me (haruoneday at gmail.com). 

It was truly enjoyable to work with all of you. I hope that you continue developing your projects onward!
