# Modeling for 3D Fabrication
## Solid modeling
Solid modeling (or modelling) is a consistent set of principles for mathematical and computer modeling of three-dimensional solids. Solid modeling is distinguished from related areas of geometric modeling and computer graphics by its emphasis on physical fidelity. [- wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_modeling)   
It results in a "watertight" model that is physically printable. The partially finished object has to be supported however, for example with a simultaneously printed scaffolding, to prevent overhanging geometires or disconnected features in the model from falling over during the printing process.

## Aesthetics in 3D: complexity is free
- The Ten Principles of 3D Printing from the book *Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing* [big think blog link](http://bigthink.com/experts-corner/the-ten-principles-of-3d-printing).  
>In his book *Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing*, Cornell University researcher Hod Lipson describes ten of the underlying principles fundamental to 3D printing. The first principle he notes is that "manufacturing complexity is free." Unlike traditional requires a more expensive mold with more parts, there is no penalty with 3D printing when an object is made more complex. On the contrary, in some cases there may even be a benefit.. With 3D printing, designers and artists can explore new kinds of highly complex and intricate forms that would have been impossible to realize with traditional techniques, and these come at no extra cost. - Printing Things.

# 3D modeling by applying Voronoi patterns
## Voronoi diagram

-  The above image shows the Delauney triangles (thin lines) and associated Direchlet Tesselations (thick lines) for nine generating points. Triangle edges are perpendicular bisectors of the tile edges. Points within a tile are closer to the tile's generating point than to any other generating point.  
	From [Paul Bourke, Efficient Triangulation Algorithm Suitable for Terrain Modelling, 1989](http://paulbourke.net/papers/triangulate/)  

- [Voronoi Diagram from the worlfram mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/VoronoiDiagram.html)

	A Voronoi diagram is created from the partitioning of a plane with *n* points into convex polygons such that each polygon contains exactly one generating point and every point in a given polygon is closer to its generating point than to any other. A Voronoi diagram is sometimes also known as a Dirichlet tessellation. The cells are called Dirichlet regions, Thiessen polytopes, or Voronoi polygons.

	Voronoi diagrams were considered as early at 1644 by Ren Descartes and were used by Dirichlet (1850) in the investigation of positive quadratic forms. They were also studied by Voronoi (1907), who extended the investigation of Voronoi diagrams to higher dimensions. They find widespread applications in areas such as computer graphics, epidemiology, geophysics, and meteorology. A particularly notable use of a Voronoi diagram was the analysis of the 1854 cholera epidemic in London, in which physician John Snow determined a strong correlation of deaths with proximity to a particular (and infected) water pump on Broad Street.

### Nervous system
"**Nervous System** is a generative design studio that works at the intersection of science, art, and technology. Drawing inspiration from natural phenomena, we create computer simulations to generate designs and use digital fabrication to realize products."

### Protocells trainer
[Shamees Aden's Protocells trainer](http://www.dezeen.com/2013/12/11/3d-printed-trainers-synthetic-biology-protocells-shamees-aden-wearable-futures/) would be 3D-printed to the exact size of the user's foot from a material that would fit like a second skin. 

"You would take the trainers home and you would have to care for it as if it was a plant, making sure it has the natural resources needed to rejuvenate the cells," said the designer.

# Modeling software
## Meshlab
**A processing system for 3D triangular meshes.**

MeshLab is an advanced mesh processing system, for the automatic and user-assisted editing, cleaning, filtering, converting, and rendering of large unstructured 3D triangular meshes. MeshLab is actively developed by a small group at the Visual Computing Lab at the ISTI CNR institute, a large group of university students, and some great developers from the rest of the world. For basic mesh processing tasks and for its internal data structures the system relies on the GPL VCG library.

	Meshmixer is a free 3D sculpting-based CAD (Computer Assisted Design) program created by Autodesk as part of their 123D software line. Autodesk is best known for releasing premium-rate professional-grade software like Maya and 3Ds Max, while their 123D  line of free software can be seen as a simpler, beginner-friendly versions of those professional programs. Meshmixer can be used to intuitively sculpt designs, hollow them out, cut them apart, and combine parts together without wrecking a meshs internal or external geometry. It also covers how to prepare a design for 3D printing.

# Assignment
- Review the class material.  
- Recreate voronoi object using Meshmixer primitive objects and import it to Meshlab. Upload your Meshlab screenshots and .stl file to Tumblr. Please use "a02 by your name and date".  
	- [Autodesk Meshmixer 101 tutorial Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlCjuIIVDuw&index=1&list=PLu8TYSQ5jCFjdQBHsLoybhdKXOTmpTRlb)  
	
- Please share your mesh data by creating a link to your mesh and posting the link to the Tumblr.  	

## Q&A from today's class
	Q. Should I use Meshlab or Meshmixer, or both, to make my Voronoi model?	
		A. Please practice your Voronoi making with Meshlab, but for the assignment, you can use either Meshlab or Meshmixer. With Meshlab you can see more deeply what is happening while processing your Voronoi model. But I know it is **very** complex.
		
	Q. How can I upload the mesh data to Tumblr?
		A. You can use Dropbox or Google drive services. In the case of Dropbox, you move your mesh data into a Dropbox folder, right mouse click to see a menu window, click "Copy Dropbox Link", and paste the link to the post in Tumblr. For Google Drive it is similar.
		
	Q. What if I can't find my mesh data from last week?
		A. This is a late announcement so it is ok if you don't post the data from last week. However please keep all the mesh data you have made so far with you. Later you can use them to print or post process them to make greater things.
		
	Thank you very much!!
