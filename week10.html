# 3D sculpt

3D sculpt tool can allowed for many artists, the freedom of creation to manifest visually compelling sculptures, abstract shapes, and free-flowing forms. It also offers very powerful and intuitive 3D paint tool. Today we will work on the simpler version of Z-brush, Pixologic’s Sculptris.

----------------------
## Case study

----------------

# Sculptris 
Pixologic’s Sculptris is a scaled-down version of ZBrush. One of best free software for organic modeling.

## Features
### Freeform Design in Sculptris

The challenge with most CAD, precision-based modeling tools is that the solid-modeling design process can be time-consuming. Organic modeling tools such as Sculptris offer immediate satisfaction by allowing designers to pull, stretch, and contort a digital “ball of clay.” While initially the process is less precise, the digital ball of clay can be refined to create highly detailed objects. A model being developed using Sculptris’ freeform techniques is similar to sculpture created by an artist using clay in the real world. With Sculptris, highly intricate and organic forms can be developed quickly, giving the designer instant satisfaction as the digital model is being developed.

### Levels of Detail

Models created in freeform, organic tools such as Sculptris are no different from models found in most other 3D-modeling applications since a 3D model in Sculptris is nothing more than a polygonal object composed of tessellated faces. The main difference is that the faces on a model using a digital sculpting application such as Sculptris can number into the thousands, or even millions. The polygon faces found on a Sculptris model are extremely small, sometimes the size of pixel. Since the polygons are so small, they are imperceptible as the designer manipulates and stretches the Sculptris model to create new forms. Because of the many polygonal faces involved, models in organic sculpting packages such as Sculptris are referred to as high-resolution geometry. This high-resolution geometry can be more clearly seen by observing a Sculptris model in wireframe mode.

Image Note  Hitting the W key in Sculptris allows users to see the wireframe of the model, which reveals the many triangle faces with greater clarity. This is called wireframe mode.

### Navigation in Sculptris

Clicking and dragging freely allows users to rotate the model they are working on. Pressing Alt/Option while clicking and dragging will pan the view. Pressing Ctrl/Cmd while right-clicking and dragging will allow you to zoom in and out of the scene. The scroll wheel on a three-button mouse will allow zooming in and out as well.

## How to Use Sculptris

The workflow for Sculptris is pretty simple. When the application is first opened, centered in the screen will be a spherical, digital ball of clay. In the upper-left corner are the sculpting tools that will let you push, pull, and distort the clay sphere (Figure 8-3).

Importing and exporting a model into Sculptris

## Experiment and explore

Begin by manipulating the spherical ball with the Draw tool. The Draw tool, if not already selected (selected tools are highlighted in orange), can be accessed by pressing the D keyboard shortcut.

Play with several of the sliders in horizontal menu as you draw.

Increase or decrease the Size slider to change the area being sculpted (Figure 8-4).

Increasing or decreasing the Strength slider changes the intensity of the brush (Figure 8-5). Increasing the value affects the amount of surface detail affected and applies a higher level of distortion (depending on the sculpting tool selected) to the digital clay.

As you draw, you will first notice that your actions are duplicated on the other side of the sphere. This is because, by default, Symmetry is enabled. If you want to disable Symmetry, turn off the Symmetry button circled in Figure 8-6. When Symmetry is turned on, the button is highlighted in orange.

Experiment with various brushes as you get used to the sculpting process. Adjust the size, strength, and quality as you sculpt. If things get messy, try using the Smooth tool and reduce the complexity of the model (Figure 8-9). You can also activate the functionality of the Smooth tool by using the Shift key as you sculpt (to learn more about the Smooth tool and other sculpting tools, please consult the following section).

## A Breakdown of the Sculpting Tools in Sculptris

- [Sculptris edutechwiki docu](https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Sculptris)

## Tools
There are nine basic sculpting tools in the Sculptris

### The Crease Tool

The Crease tool makes a sharp indentation into the sculpted surface. The effect is similar to using a sharp stick to draw gouges into clay (Figure 8-10). Inverting the brush (hit the X key or hold down Option/Alt while you sculpt) will create sharp ridges (Figure 8-11).

### The Draw Tool

The Draw tool creates a rounded, hill-like extrusion on the surface on the model (Figure 8-12). Selecting Inverse creates a trough-like recess in the surface. Using the Clay option creates a flatter plateau on the surface (Figure 8-14). The Soft option helps give the stroke smoother edges.

### The Flatten Tool

The Flatten tool levels the surface off to a flat plane (Figure 8-15).

### The Inflate Tool

Inflate will make an area balloon outward. If the detail is set to the highest setting and Inflate is used multiple times, it’s possible to create long tentacles that extend out from the surface (Figure 8-16). Using the Alt/Option keyboard shortcut has the opposite effect, creating hollows and holes in the surface (Figure 8-17).

### The Pinch Tool

Pinch draws the polygons on the surface to create creases and ridges. Using Pinch is a good way to get hard edges on the surface of the sculpted object (Figure 8-18).

### The Grab Tool

The Grab tool will push and pull large sections of the model. This is a great way to develop the initial form of a model before more detailed sculpting occurs

### The Smooth Tool

The Smooth tool will diminish areas of high detail and bring back the original surfaces.

- Note: Holding the Shift key while sculpting will provide the equivalent functionality of using the Smooth tool.
