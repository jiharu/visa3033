# 3D Sculpt

3D sculpt tools can allow many artists the freedom of creation to manifest visually compelling sculptures, abstract shapes, and free-flowing forms. They also offer very powerful and intuitive 3D painting. Today we will work with Sculptris.

## Case study

- [Dorry Hsu](http://www.dorryhsu.com/)  
![dorry](img/10/DORRY-HSU-38.jpg)  
Aesthetic of Fears, 2014.  
Dorry Hsu's new collection ‘the aesthetic of fears’, is‭ ‬the finalist of International Talent Support‭ ‬with the Swarovski‭, ‬and Swatch Projects,‭ ‬2013‭.‬‭ ‬In this collection‭,‬‭ ‬Dorry‭ ‬well‭ ‬uses‭ ‬the‭ ‬quality of‭ ‬3D‭ ‬print‭ ‬and‭ ‬color dye the‭ ‬transplant‭ ‬material –‭ ‬SLA‭.‬‭ ‬The‭ ‬handmade‭ ‬color‭ ‬dye‭ ‬gives‭ ‬the‭ ‬new‭ ‬energy‭ ‬and dimension of the‭ ‬3D print objects.‭ ‬Dorry challenges‭ ‬the‭ ‬possibilities of‭ ‬complexity forms and colors in 3D‭ ‬print‭ ‬SLA‭. ‬She‭ ‬recreates‭ ‬the‭ ‬objects‭ ‬of reflecting‭ ‬self fears with the‭ ‬bugs of many legs. She said‭ ‬“‭ ‬my collection is about the aesthetic and the attraction of fears‭. ‬I am interesting about the concept of masks‭. ‬In many cultures‭, ‬people wear mask to scare evil away‭, ‬so the mask are decorated with the frightening images from‭ ‬the wearer’s fears.”‭ ‬In this series of work‭, ‬Dorry keeps the print out pixel as‭ ‬a material‭ ‬texture to represent the‭ ‬quality of 3D print.‭ ‬Furthermore‭, ‬using the color dye latex to match the‭ ‬SLA‭ ‬material‭ ‬quality‭ ‬and improve the comfortable of wearing‭. ‬The‭ ‬3D‭ ‬print object can fit on the‭ ‬body‭ ‬curve‭ ‬comfortably‭. ‬

# Sculptris 
Pixologic’s Sculptris is a scaled-down version of ZBrush, a professional 3D sculpting software. Sculptris is one of best free software for organic modeling.

## Freeform design

The challenge with most CAD precision-based modeling tools is that the solid-modeling design process can be time-consuming, and not particularly suited for organic forms. Organic modeling tools such as Sculptris offer immediate satisfaction by allowing designers to pull, stretch, and contort a digital “ball of clay.” While initially the process is less precise, the digital ball of clay can be refined to create highly detailed objects. A model being developed using Sculptris’ freeform techniques is similar to sculpture created by an artist using clay in the real world. With Sculptris, highly intricate and organic forms can be developed quickly, giving the designer instant satisfaction as the digital model is being developed.

## Levels of detail

Models created in freeform, organic tools such as Sculptris are no different from models found in most other 3D-modeling applications since a 3D model in Sculptris is nothing more than a polygonal object composed of tessellated faces. The main difference is that the faces on a model using a digital sculpting application such as Sculptris can number into the thousands, or even millions. The polygon faces found on a Sculptris model are extremely small, sometimes the size of pixel. Since the polygons are so small, they are imperceptible as the designer manipulates and stretches the Sculptris model to create new forms. Because of the many polygonal faces involved, models in organic sculpting packages such as Sculptris are referred to as high-resolution geometry. This high-resolution geometry can be more clearly seen by observing a Sculptris model in wireframe mode.

Note: Hitting the W key in Sculptris allows users to see the wireframe of the model, which reveals the many triangle faces with greater clarity. This is called wireframe mode.

-----------------------------------------------

## Practice

The workflow for Sculptris is pretty simple. When the application is first opened, centered in the screen will be a spherical, digital ball of clay. In the upper-left corner are the sculpting tools that will let you push, pull, and distort the clay sphere. 

![howto](img/10/sculptris.png)

### Navigation

Clicking and dragging freely allows users to rotate the model they are working on. Pressing Alt/Option while clicking and dragging will pan the view. Pressing Ctrl/Cmd while right-clicking and dragging will allow you to zoom in and out of the scene. The scroll wheel on a three-button mouse will allow zooming in and out as well.

## A. Experiment and explore
- Begin by manipulating the spherical ball with the **Draw tool**. The Draw tool, if not already selected (selected tools are highlighted in orange), can be accessed by pressing the D keyboard shortcut.

- Play with several of the sliders in horizontal menu as you draw.

	- Increase or decrease the **Size** slider to change the area being sculpted.
	- Increasing or decreasing the **Strength** slider changes the intensity of the brush.
	- Increasing the **Detail** value affects the amount of surface detail affected and applies a higher level of distortion (depending on the sculpting tool selected) to the digital clay.

As you draw, you will first notice that your actions are duplicated on the other side of the sphere. This is because, by default, **Symmetry** is enabled. If you want to disable Symmetry, turn off the Symmetry button. When Symmetry is turned on, the button is highlighted in orange.

Experiment with various brushes as you get used to the sculpting process. Adjust the size, strength, and quality as you sculpt. If things get messy, try using the Smooth tool and reduce the complexity of the model. You can also activate the functionality of the Smooth tool by using the **Shift** key as you sculpt.

## A breakdown of the sculpting tools

- [Sculptris cheat sheet](http://members.casema.nl/jw.v.dronkelaar/sculptris_cheat_sheet.pdf)  

There are nine basic sculpting tools in the Sculptris

![howto01](img/10/sculptris01.png)

### The Crease tool

The Crease tool makes a sharp indentation into the sculpted surface. The effect is similar to using a sharp stick to draw gouges into clay. **Inverting** the brush (hit the **X key** or hold down **Option/Alt** while you sculpt) will create sharp ridges.

### The Draw tool

The Draw tool creates a rounded, hill-like extrusion on the surface on the model. Selecting Inverse creates a trough-like recess in the surface. Using the **Clay** option creates a flatter plateau on the surface. The **Soft** option helps give the stroke smoother edges.

### The Flatten tool

The Flatten tool levels the surface off to a flat plane.

### The Inflate tool

Inflate will make an area balloon outward. If the detail is set to the highest setting and Inflate is used multiple times, it’s possible to create long tentacles that extend out from the surface. Using the Alt/Option keyboard shortcut has the opposite effect, creating hollows and holes in the surface.

### The Pinch tool

Pinch draws the polygons on the surface to create creases and ridges. Using Pinch is a good way to get hard edges on the surface of the sculpted object.

### The Grab tool

The Grab tool will push and pull large sections of the model. This is a great way to develop the initial form of a model before more detailed sculpting occurs.

### The Smooth tool

The Smooth tool will diminish areas of high detail and bring back the original surfaces.

- Note: Holding the **Shift** key while sculpting will provide the equivalent functionality of using the Smooth tool.

## Workflow examples
### Sculptris and MeshMixer
- In Sculptris, you can sculpt a geometry and export it as a .obj. 
- In MeshMixer, you can import the geometry from Sculptris 
	- Define its size: Edit / Transform.
	- Check if it is a solid object: Edit / Make Solid.
	- Hollow the geometry. You can decide the wall thickness: Edit / Hollow
	- Applying Voronoi or other patterns. 
	
		![sctomm02](img/10/meshmixer01.png)
		![sctomm03](img/10/bust_voro.png)
	
	- Examine and fix the geometry using tools in the Analysis toolset. 
	- Then you can go to Print to prepare a mesh for printing. 
	
		![sctomm01](img/10/meshmixer.png)


### Sculptris and Maya
- In Maya, create a low polygon object. Export it as .obj 
- In Sculptris, import your Maya object. What you can do includes:	
	- Sculpting: use the Maya model as a base model, you can develop your organic modeling. Once it is done, you can use the model data as it is or you can create a normal map too. 
	- Level of detail: you can create high-resolution modeling.
	- Painting: you can work to create color, normal, and bump textures. Also you can export the geometry as .obj file.
- In Maya, import the obj file from Sculptris.
	- You can apply a shader and assign textures from Sculptris for color.
	- You can examine and fix the mesh. 
	- You can add thickness using **Mesh Tools / Extrude : Local translate Z.
	
	![sctom01](img/10/maya01.png)
	 
	- You can smooth the edge or surface.
	
	![sctom](img/10/bevel.png) 
	![sctom02](img/10/maya02.png) 
- Then you can export it for the full color 3D fabrication. Check the week 5 course website for a reminder of how.
