## 3D Scanning
### Contact scanners

### Photogrammetry
Photogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs.

The output of photogrammetry is typically a map, drawing, measurement, or a 3D model of some real-world object or scene. Many of the maps we use today are created with photogrammetry and photographs taken from aircraft. [http://www.photogrammetry.com/](http://www.photogrammetry.com/)

## Case study
### Photogrammetry
#### Shining

- [SHINING360 by Claire Hentschker](http://www.clairesophie.com/shining360/)  
Shining360 is a 30-minute audio-visual experiment for VR derived from the physical space within Stanley Kubrick's film ‘The Shining.'  Using photogrammetry, 3D elements are extracted and extruded from the original film stills, and the subsequent fragments are stitched together and viewed along the original camera path.

### Using Skanect to create a miniature bust  
For this exercise, you should get your hands on a Microsoft Kinect 1 sensor or an Xtion Pro by Asus, two accessories that use PrimeSense technology. If you have a Sense, iSense, or Structure sensor, the procedure will be similar, but the software interface will be different.

- [ARC 3D Webservice: A Family of Web Tools for Remote 3D Reconstruction](http://www.arc3d.be/)  
	ARC3D is a tool for creating 3D models out of a set of images.  

- [PhotoCloud](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/photocloud/index.php)  
	PhotoCloud is a real-time client-server system for interactive visualization and exploration of large datasets comprising thousands of calibrated 2D photographs of a scene and a complex 3D description of the scene. The system includes a compact image browser and a multiresolution model renderer. PhotoCloud employs iconic visualization of the images in the 3D space and projects images onto the 3D scene on the fly. Users can navigate the 2D and 3D spaces with smooth, integrated, seamless transitions between them.

## Application
### Autodesk
- [123D Catch](www.123dapp.com/catch)  
	- Using 123D Catch to create a 3D scan:
	Begin by installing the 123D Catch application on your Apple or Android mobile device. A window PC compatible version also exists, but it requires the use of a digital camera and behaves different than the mobile version. You have to log into your 123D account to use all of the application’s features.

- [ReCap 360](http://www.autodesk.com/products/recap-360/)  
Import, view, and convert real-world objects into point clouds for conceptual modeling. Your laser scans and photos are registered automatically, creating an accurate 3D model in just a few minutes. With less manual processing, you'll have more time to focus on other important parts of your business.
	- [AUTODESK RECAP 360 REVIEW](http://3dscanexpert.com/autodesk-photogrammetry-review-recap-360/)  
- [Remake, formerly known as Memento](http://remake.autodesk.com/about)	  
ReMake is an end-to-end solution for converting reality captured with photos or scans into high-definition 3D meshes. These meshes that can be cleaned up, fixed, edited, scaled, measured, re-topologized, decimated, aligned, compared and optimized for downstream workflows entirely in ReMake. It handles reverse engineering as support for design and engineering, for asset creation for AR/VR, film, game, art, for archiving and preserving heritage, digital fabrication or publishing interactive experiences on the Web and mobile.
	- [Download the program](http://remake.autodesk.com/try-remake)  
		- Mac version of Remake is currently promotionally free for a limited period.
		- Student version is free for 3 years.

	GREY/CHROME BALL: These balls are used to find the intensity (grey ball) and direction (chrome ball) of the light. These two values will be used to recreate same lighting conditions in 3d space to get the shadow data to delight the original texture. The delighting process will be explained in a later tutorial.
