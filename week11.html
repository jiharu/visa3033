## 3D Scanning
### Contact scanners

### Non-contact scanners

- [Lucida: The 3D laser scanner for conservation](http://www.factum-arte.com/pag/682/Lucida)  
Lucida is a 3D laser scanner custom built by Factum Arte with financial and logistical support from Factum Foundation. Conceived and developed by artist and engineer Manuel Franquelo, this system is the result of fourteen years of research into the high-resolution recording of the surface of paintings and relief objects.

### Photogrammetry
Photogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs.  
The output of photogrammetry is typically a map, drawing, measurement, or a 3D model of real-world object or scene. [http://www.photogrammetry.com/](http://www.photogrammetry.com/)

- [SHINING360 by Claire Hentschker](http://www.clairesophie.com/shining360/)  
Shining360 is a 30-minute audio-visual experiment for VR derived from the physical space within Stanley Kubrick's film ‘The Shining.'  Using photogrammetry, 3D elements are extracted and extruded from the original film stills, and the subsequent fragments are stitched together and viewed along the original camera path.

## Application
### Autodesk
- [123D Catch](www.123dapp.com/catch)  
	- Using 123D Catch to create a 3D scan:
	Begin by installing the 123D Catch application on your Apple or Android mobile device. A Windows PC compatible version also exists, but it requires the use of a digital camera and behaves differently than the mobile version. You have to log into your 123D account to use all of the application’s features.

- [ReCap 360](http://www.autodesk.com/products/recap-360/)  
Import, view, and convert real-world objects into point clouds for conceptual modeling. Your laser scans and photos are registered automatically, creating an accurate 3D model in just a few minutes. With less manual processing, you'll have more time to focus on other important parts of your business.
	- [AUTODESK RECAP 360 REVIEW](http://3dscanexpert.com/autodesk-photogrammetry-review-recap-360/)  
- [Remake, formerly known as Memento](http://remake.autodesk.com/about)	  
ReMake is an end-to-end solution for converting reality captured with photos or scans into high-definition 3D meshes. These meshes can be cleaned up, fixed, edited, scaled, measured, re-topologized, decimated, aligned, compared and optimized for downstream workflows entirely in ReMake. It handles reverse engineering as support for design and engineering, for asset creation for AR/VR, film, game, art, for archiving and preserving heritage, digital fabrication or publishing interactive experiences on the Web and mobile.
	- [Download the program](http://remake.autodesk.com/try-remake)  
		- The Mac version of Remake is currently promotionally free for a limited period.
		- The Student version is free for 3 years.

### Web based client-server system
- [ARC 3D Webservice: A Family of Web Tools for Remote 3D Reconstruction](http://www.arc3d.be/)  
	ARC3D is a group of tools for creating 3D models out of a set of images, allowing users to upload digital images to the servers where they perform a 3D reconstruction of the scene and report the output back to the user. They also provide a tool for producing and visualising the 3D scene using the data computed on their servers.	
	
- [PhotoCloud](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/photocloud/index.php)  
	PhotoCloud is a real-time client-server system for interactive visualization and exploration of large datasets comprising thousands of calibrated 2D photographs of a scene and a complex 3D description of the scene. The system includes a compact image browser and a multiresolution model renderer. PhotoCloud employs iconic visualization of the images in the 3D space and projects images onto the 3D scene on the fly. Users can navigate the 2D and 3D spaces with smooth, integrated, seamless transitions between them.

- [Point cloud, wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud)
A point cloud is a set of data points in some coordinate system.  
In a three-dimensional coordinate system, these points are usually defined by X, Y, and Z coordinates, and often are intended to represent the external surface of an object.  
Point clouds may be created by 3D scanners. These devices measure a large number of points on an object's surface, and often output a point cloud as a data file. The point cloud represents the set of points that the device has measured.

	GREY/CHROME BALL: These balls are used to find the intensity (grey ball) and direction (chrome ball) of the light. These two values will be used to recreate same lighting conditions in 3d space to get the shadow data to delight the original texture. The delighting process will be explained in a later tutorial.

## Appendix
### How to photograph your art
[Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpj28da03JQ)   
[Article link](http://arthistory.about.com/od/collecting_and_appraising/l/bl_photoartqt.htm)
> In summary, to take the best possible shot of your work of art you need to: 
  
>- Make sure your view is square, plumb and level.   
- Use indirect lighting (and turn off your flash).   
- Keep your hands (camera) steady.   
- Crop your photo to remove anything behind your artwork.
