### Printing
- The Makerbot Replicator 2 uses the **x3g file format** for printing:  
	x3g: this is a binary file that the machine reads which contains all of the instructions for printing. The MakerBot Desktop software can be setup to output this file format directly. The output x3g file can then be printed in two ways. You can copy it to the machine’s SD card and use the built-in LCD menu or you can stream the file directly to your machine via a connected USB cable.

- [MakerBot Desktop Software docu](https://support.makerbot.com/Learn/makerbot-desktop-software)  

### Print settings per material 

- PLA (Only on Replicator 2)
- Print temp: 220°C ~ 230°C (at 90 ~ 100 mm/s, 40 ~ 50 mm/s)
- Notes: heated bed optional between 40 and 60°C

### Speed vs. Quality settings
 
- Quality  
For the highest quality print choose 10% infill and a layer height of 0.1 mm. Depending on the print, kick down the speed even further to below the Makerware advised settings. Although these settings result in the highest quality, as a beginner it is advised to first get comfortable with all the settings at “medium” or “low” quality. Highest quality prints also have a higher failure rate.
 
- Speed  
If you want to print very fast you could of course crank up the extrusion speed to 100 mm/s but there are other possibilities as well. Setting the infill to 0% will result in a super fast, but hollow print, making your Makerbot Replicator 2 whistle due to its active cooling (no harm done). But be careful: some prints will collapse since they become too unstable to support their own exterior structure.

- [What is the influence of infill %, layer height and infill pattern on my 3D prints?  
 Quality / speed / strength / cost.](http://my3dmatter.com/influence-infill-layer-height-pattern/)  
 
### Supporting
 
- Rafts  
Enabling the raft option will provide your print with a broader first layer. This is especially helpful with larger prints because it will **reduce warping** and help the print stick better to the building platform. However you will have to spend some time afterwards cleaning up the print. 

- [Rafts, Skirts and Brims!](https://www.simplify3d.com/support/articles/rafts-skirts-and-brims/)

- Support  
Makerware offers one option for support. This should be used in cases of extreme overhang (over 45 degrees), but is dependent on the shape as well. When crossing a gap between two objects, the overhang can in some case be more than 45 degrees without any need for support.

### Machine Hygiene/Maintenance
 
- Leveling the build plate  
Leveling the build plate frequently is very important to keep your machine in top notch condition. Even a very small inaccuracy can make the difference between a good and a poor print. Run the standard procedure from your printer’s menu and use a business card for the correct distance between your nozzle and build plate.
 
- Cool Down Time  
The best thing to do after a print has been completed is to cool down your machine entirely before switching it off. But, if you are in a rush, make sure to at least get it under 100°C before switching it off. 
 
- Build plate cleaning  
It is important that your build plate provides a rough surface in order for prints to be able to stick to it. Grease from either your hands or lubricating the machine is something you do not want. Make sure you completely clean the build plate on a regular basis, preferably with some acetone and a lint free towel. Need a quick fix for adhesion problems? Try prepping your build plate with a thin layer of glue from a glue stick.
 
- Lubrication  
Nearly all the parts of the Replicator 2 & 2X are self lubricating apart from the threaded rod and x-axis idler pulley. To improve the overall life of your printer, make sure to lubricate them once you start hearing squeaky noises or after 50 hours of printing.

## G-code generators for 3D printers
- [Slic3r](http://slic3r.org/)  
Slic3r is the tool you need to convert a 3D model into printing instructions for your 3D printer. It cuts the model into horizontal slices (layers), generates toolpaths to fill them and calculates the amount of material to be extruded.  
Slic3r is based on a community of people working collaboratively on GitHub, discussing new features and testing them. It's being used by thousands of people all over the world, and there are more than 500 forks of it. It's a non-profit project. 3D printing became a business since the RepRap community was born, but we want to keep 3D printing free, and Slic3r will always be an independent project, not driven by any business or single vendor.


- [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software)  
Cura is the 3D model to toolpath Slicer by David (David Braam). Cura is free Open Source software released on the AGPLv3 license.
It is currently maintained by Ultimaker who employed David to work on it. Cura is well suited for Bowden-extruder machines like the Ultimaker and most Delta-bots. also you can use it with most of reprap printers. Cura features it's own Slicing engine, GCode sender and other tools to provide an "all in one" solution for 3D printing. However all components can be used on their own.

## Case study	
### Printing with reusable material
- [The Hyrel 3D Printers Let Users Print with Recycled Materials](http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/3d-ink) 

--------------------
## Design Guidelines for Successful Modeling for 3D Printing
From the book Beginning Design for 3D Printing by Joe Micallef, Apress, 2015

- Part heights
- Build orientation
- Overhangs and angled geometry (the 45-degree rule)
- Repeated overhangs
- Part thickness
- Connected parts
- Fine details
- Chamfers    
(Chamfers are a type of bevel that can be added to the corners of objects to flatten out edges)
- Recesses and holes
- Work with gravity, bridges, and arc
- Pinnacles
- Dividing objects into pieces and creating assemblies for best outcomes
- Hollow parts

--------------------------------------
## How to analyze and fix your model 

- [Materialise cloud: online tools to prepare your models for 3D printing](https://cloud.materialise.com/tools)  

### 3D files
We need specific format of 3D modeling data that can “tell” the printer what is to be printed.

- [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) (STereoLithography): The STL file simply defines points in space and connects those points together to form a series of triangles, which in total, are called a “mesh” or “mesh object.” The file is called a “shell model” and can be thought of as a thin skin with a hollow interior.  

- [OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) .OBJ format is considered to be more complex than .STL file for the fact that it is capable of representing texture, color and other CAD attributes of the three-dimensional object. .OBJ is also easily exported from most CAD tools and is supported by 3D printers.

The big difference between STL and OBJ meshes is what’s displayed on the surface. STL files don’t display any data on the surface of the mesh. They indicate only the surface itself–the geometry of the object, how big it is and the shape of its sides, but that’s about it. That’s why STLs are greyscale by default.
