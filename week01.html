# Modeling for 3D Fabrication
## What is 3D printing?
- **3D printing** is the colloquial term for a group of technologies known as additive manufacturing based on a digital 3D model file.  

	![week1_01](img/pipeline.png)
	
	- **Additive process**   
	Additive sculpture is the process of creating sculpture by adding material to create the work: modeling with clay, wax, plaster, and paper-maché. However strictly speaking, additive manufacture is different from most other traditional manufacturing methods.  
		- Casting: a mold is used to form molten material into a desired shape.  
	- **Subtractive process**  
	Subtractive sculpture is the oldest form of sculpture and involves removing material, as in wood carving or stone sculpture, to create a finished work. Subtractive sculpture is by far the most technically difficult and due to the nature of the medium is the most restrictive in expression: carving, milling, and cutting.  
	- Other construction methods
		- Attachment: welding, gluing, sawing, nailing materials together.     
		- Assembly: the act of connecting together the parts of something such as a machine.

- **2011:** DIY 3D printers and the first online 3D printing services not only for business-to-business but also as an online creative community.

### Early 3D printed artwork

![week1_1](img/fujihata.jpeg)  
Masaki Fujihata, 'Forbidden Fruits', 1990. Digital photograph of stereolithographic objects. 

"In 1982, I had dived into computer graphics field as a art director with 3 technical people. After spending 4 years for generating moving images on video tape, I had felt frustration with the computer images, because the image was generated with 3D data but we can not touch that 3D object. I had had strong desire to materialize the object which is from computer data, for touching the surface. The results were shown as computer generated sculpture in 1987 titled Geometric Love, NC milling machine was used for realization and in 1990 titled Forbidden Fruits, Stereo lithography technology was used." [from Fujihata's artist statement.](http://www.iamas.ac.jp/interaction/i97/artist_Fujihata.html)  

![week1_2](img/collins.gif)  
Dan Collins, 'Of More Than Two Minds', hydrocal casting, 1993. 

This sculpture was produced by capturing the movement of the artist using 3D laser scanning. The scanned data was then translated to a CAD model that was subsequently milled in wax using CNC milling. Wax prototyped translated into hydrocal casting.

## 3D printing methods
### Binding process
Printing objects by using a printhead to bind a pre-spread layer of material, each time tracing and binding the cross sections of the object.

- Stereolithography (SLA): Photosensitive resins of various types, clear or colored, in liquid form, poured into printing machine container. Material is hardened by ultraviolet light from laser. Remaining resin is reused. 

- Selective Laser Sintering (SLS): Powders of polymers such as nylon (plain, glass-filled, or with other fillers) or polystyrene - metals including steel, titanium, gold, silver, alloy mixtures – ceramics of various kinds. High energy laser beam sinters (melts) the powder to form layers and attaching layers to each other. Unsintered powder serves as support for object until completed, then is reused.	

- Inkjet Powder Printing (3DP)

- Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM)

### Deposition Processes
Using a printhead to deposit the material itself on the previous section of extruded material.

- Fused Deposition Modeling [FDM]: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is an additive manufacturing technology that builds parts up layer-by-layer by heating and extruding thermoplastic filament.

- Polyjet
>- [Stratasys video](http://www.stratasys.com/resources/3d-printing-videos)  
Plastic Jet Printing Process: also called Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), is the simplest and lowest cost method but limited to plastics and soft metals. Also lower precision.  Thermoplastic materials such as ABS and polycarbonates of various types. Some applications use soft metals. Material is fed into heated nozzle from a spool of thread or wire. 

- Paste Extrusion
	- [3D pen: 3Doodler PRO](http://3doodlerpro.com/) 
	- A group of University of Tokyo students overseen by architect Kengo Kuma have developed a 3D-printing pen that can be used to create complex architectural structures out of plastic sticks: ["drawn-in-place"](http://www.dezeen.com/2016/02/22/tokyo-university-research-students-3d-printed-pen-complex-architectural-structures-plastic/)

# Modeling for 3D Fabrication
## Solid modeling
Solid modeling (or modelling) is a consistent set of principles for mathematical and computer modeling of three-dimensional solids. Solid modeling is distinguished from related areas of geometric modeling and computer graphics by its emphasis on physical fidelity. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_modeling) It results in a "watertight" model that is physically printable. The partially finished object has to be supported however, for example with a simultaneously printed scaffolding, to prevent overhanging geometires or disconnected features in the model from falling over during the printing process.

### Prosthetic design 
Scott Summit demonstrates how 3D Printing and digital scanning can be used to greatly improve Prosthetic design. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wnnNk91EMs) 

### Protocells trainer
[Shamees Aden's Protocells trainer](http://www.dezeen.com/2013/12/11/3d-printed-trainers-synthetic-biology-protocells-shamees-aden-wearable-futures/) would be 3D-printed to the exact size of the user's foot from a material that would fit like a second skin. 

"You would take the trainers home and you would have to care for it as if it was a plant, making sure it has the natural resources needed to rejuvenate the cells," said the designer.
