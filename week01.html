# Modeling for 3D Fabrication
## What is 3D printing?

- The Ten Principles of 3D Printing: An excerpt from Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman's new book Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing [big think blog link](http://bigthink.com/experts-corner/the-ten-principles-of-3d-printing).

## History
### Commercial system
- **1986:** The patent of the first StereoLithography by Charles Hull/STL 3D systems. [- Patent US4575330: Apparatus for production of three-dimensional objects by stereolithography](http://www.google.com/patents/US4575330).  
- **1971 filed, 1977 opened patent**: the concepts of scanning a 3D object with a laser and reproducing this in a photopolyer as a 3D object by Wyn Kelly Swainson [- US 4041476 A:Method, medium and apparatus for producing three-dimensional figure product](http://www.google.com.au/patents/US4041476)  

#### Consumer system - open hardware


### Early 3D printed artwork

![week1_1](img/fujihata.jpeg)  
Masaki Fujihata, 'Forbidden Fruits', 1990. Digital photograph of stereolithographic objects. 

"In 1982, I had dived into computer graphics field as a art director with 3 technical people. After spending 4 years for generating moving images on video tape, I had felt frustration with the computer images, because the image was generated with 3D data but we can not touch that 3D object. I had had strong desire to materialize the object which is from computer data, for touching the surface. The results were shown as computer generated sculpture in 1987 titled Geometric Love, NC milling machine was used for realization and in 1990 titled Forbidden Fruits, Stereo lithography technology was used." [from Fujihata's artist statement.](http://www.iamas.ac.jp/interaction/i97/artist_Fujihata.html)  

![week1_2](img/collins.gif)  
Dan Collins, 'Of More Than Two Minds', hydrocal casting, 1993. 

This sculpture was produced by capturing the movement of the artist using 3D laser scanning. The scanned data was then translated to a CAD model that was subsequently milled in wax using CNC milling. Wax prototyped translated into hydrocal casting.

## 3D printing types

### Conventional construction methods
- **Subtractive process**  
	Subtractive sculpture is the oldest form of sculpture and involves removing material, as in wood carving or stone sculpture, to create a finished work. Subtractive sculpture is by far the most technically difficult and due to the nature of the medium is the most restrictive in expression: carving.
	
- **Additive process**   
	Additive sculpture describes all other forms of sculpture and the process most commonly used today. Simply put, additive sculpture is the process of creating sculpture by adding material to create the work: modeling with clay, wax, plaster, and paper-maché. 
	- Casting: a mold is used to form molten material into a desired shape.  
	
#### Assembly and attachment
- Attachment: welding, gluing, nailing materials together.     
- Assembly: the act of connecting together the parts of something such as a machine.  

## 3D printing methods
- Plastic Jet Printing Process: also called Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), is the simplest and lowest cost method but limited to plastics and soft metals. Also lower precision.  Thermoplastic materials such as ABS and polycarbonates of various types. Some applications use soft metals. Material is fed into heated nozzle from a spool of thread or wire. 

- Stereolithography (SLA): Photosensitive resins of various types, clear or colored, in liquid form, poured into printing machine container. Material is hardened by ultraviolet light from laser. Remaining resin is reused. 

- Selective Laser Sintering (SLS): Powders of polymers such as nylon (plain, glass-filled, or with other fillers) or polystyrene - metals including steel, titanium, gold, silver, alloy mixtures – ceramics of various kinds. High energy laser beam sinters (melts) the powder to form layers and attaching layers to each other. Unsintered powder serves as support for object until completed, then is reused.

## Case study
### Nervous system
Nervous System is a generative design studio that works at the intersection of science, art, and technology. Drawing inspiration from natural phenomena, we create computer simulations to generate designs and use digital fabrication to realize products.
