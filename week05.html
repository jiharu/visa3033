# The fundamental of 3D modeling 
### 3D files
We need specific 3D modeling data “tells” the printer what to print.

- STL (STereoLithography): The STL file simply defines points in space and connects those points together to form a series of triangles, which in total, are called a “mesh” or “mesh object.” The file is called a “shell model” and can be thought of as a thin skin with a hollow interior.  

- OBJ

# Model: Mobius

## A. Scale of the model 
Check the unit conversion in your software (mm to cm or similar).  
- **In Maya:**
go to 'Window / Settings/Preferences / Preferences / Settings' and set your units. Since Shapeways displays metric units, set it to centimeters.

## B. Hollowing the model
Hollowing out your model can result in a tremendous reduction of material used, and thus money spent. 
- **In Maya:**
go to 'Edit Mesh / Extrude'. From the channel box add the thickness value to **'the local translation Z'.

## C. Smoothing the model
when you complete all the processes, just before exporting the final object, you can smooth the model to gain the high refined result. 
- **In Maya:** 
do a mesh smooth 'Mesh / Smooth' with a level of 1 or 2 depending on how smooth you want it to be and how many polygons it results in. 

# Texture
## UV texturing in Maya
The below image shows how to do UV mapping and the use of place2DTexture node for the 2D texture placement.

### Process outline

1. In your 3D application, create a texture map.
In Maya, 1. an objet need UV coordinates. 2. you need to assign a material to link a texture map. 3. Export it as a obj file checking material on in the export option.  
2. Export your model to VRML97 or X3D.
We can change obj or stl to x3d in Meshlab. 
3. Create a .zip archive of the exported model, and all the texture map images - no folder included.  
4. Upload the archive.

3D Printing in Color can be difficult, especially the first time. It requires particular file formats and each CAD package has different output options.

TopMod was developed by a team at the Texas A&M Visualization Laboratory in the early 2000s. You can create basic and complex forms that can be exported for further manipulation in programs such as Meshmixer and SketchUp.
