## Topology 
- A surface, a two-dimensional manifold, looks flat in a local view, but it can have a more-interesting global structure.

- Topological objects are categorized by their genus (number of holes).

### Definition

- **Topology is the mathematical study of *shapes* and *spaces*.** It is a major area of mathematics concerned with the most basic properties of space, such as *connectedness*, *continuity* and *boundary*. It is the study of properties that are preserved under continuous deformations including stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. Topology developed as a field of study out of geometry and set theory, through analysis of such concepts as space, dimension, and transformation. 

	e.g. a Möbius strip is a kind of object studied in topology which has only one surface and one edge.

- The definition of topology leads to the following mathematical joke (Renteln and Dundes 2005)	
	
	***"What is a topologist?""***  
	***"Someone who cannot distinguish between a doughnut and a coffee cup."*** [Wolfram mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Topology.html)<!-- [위상이란 무엇인가?](http://mathnmath.tistory.com/39)   -->

### More examples

There are many surfaces with a variety of looks that are topologically the same.

# Color texture in 3D printing
## Printing via Shapeways
- [Full Color Sandstone Material Information](https://www.shapeways.com/materials/full-color-sandstone)  
- [Exporting to VRML and X3D for color printing](https://www.shapeways.com/tutorials/exporting_to_vrml_and_x3d_for_color_printing)  

	Uploading a file with texture maps requires a few steps: 

	- In your 3D application, create a texture map.
		- UV texture
		- JPG or PNG format.
		- The total resolution of your texture maps below 2048x2048 pixels.
	- Export your model to VRML97 or X3D.
	- Create a .zip archive of the exported model, and all the texture map images.
	- Upload ***the archive***.

## UV texturing in Maya
The below image shows how to do UV mapping and the use of place2DTexture node for the 2D texture placement.

## Reference
- [LGM: EXPORTING A MODEL WITH COLOR AND/OR TEXTURE MAPS](http://www.lgm3d.com/blog/exporting-a-model-with-color-and-or-texture-maps)  
3D Printing in Color can be difficult, especially the first time. It requires particular file formats and each CAD package has different output options.  

# Practice
## In Maya
### Assigning a texture to a geometry
- Create a sphere (Create / Polygon primitives / Sphere)  
- Assign a general material such as a Blinn, Phong, or Lambert shader. (In the pop window from RMB, choose one from Assign Favorite Material)  
- Choose the sphere, and open the attribute editor.  
- We can assign a texture from the Color attribute.
- We can adjust the texture using the 2D placement manipulator or at the 'place2dTexture3' from the attribute editor.  
### Save as an obj file with a texture. 
- If the texture is not a bitmap texture, you need to save it as bitmap file. (You can do it at the UV texture window)  
- If the texture is a bitmap texture, when you export the geometry as the obj file, please set the Materials to be on.

# General preparation of a mesh for 3D printing
## A. Scale of the model 
Check the unit conversion in your software (mm to cm or similar).  

### In Maya:
Go to 'Window / Settings/Preferences / Preferences / Settings' and set your units. Since Shapeways displays metric units, set it to *centimeters*.

## B. Hollowing out the model
Hollowing out your model can result in a tremendous reduction of material used, and thus money spent. 

### In Maya:
Go to 'Edit Mesh / Extrude'.   
From the channel box, add a thickness value to **'the local translation Z'**.

## C. Smoothing the model
When you complete all the processes, just before exporting the final object, you can smooth the model to gain a more highly refined result. 

### In Maya: 
Do a mesh smooth 'Mesh / Smooth' with a level of 1 or 2, depending on how smooth you want it to be and how many polygons it results in. 

------------------------------------
# Practice
## Creating a Möbius strip in Maya
- Create a box (Create / Polygon primitives / box)  
- At the right of the work space, under the Channel box, there is an Inputs section. Change the value as in the image below:

![mb01](img/05/mb01.png)

- Change the menu module set from Modeling to Rigging (upper left corner). Go to Deform / Nonlinear / Twist) and apply it. From the channel box, change the Rotate Z value to 90. 

![mb02](img/05/mb02.png)

- Go to Deform / Nonlinear / Bend) and apply it. From the channel box, change the Rotate Z value to 90 and from the Inputs node, change the curvature value to 180 degree.

---------------------------------------
## UV mapping in Maya
- Choose the object
- Go to UV / Planar. From its option box, choose Fit projection to Best plane and apply it. 
	
	![uv](img/05/uv.png)
- Open the UV texture editor from Window menu to verify the UV texture	

## Preparing a panoramic texture
- Prepare a panoramic image (width can be 1K pixel)  
- Using the photoshop, go to Image / Image size and change the parameter as the image below:

![photo](img/05/hamilton.png)

- Save the image.

-------------------------------------------------
## Applying texture in Maya
- Select the object or faces and assign a material. From the material attributes you can link a file from its color attribute. 

![tex01](img/05/tex01.png)

### Select object
- Choose the object and from right mouse button, you can choose the Assign Favorite Material and choose Blinn, Lambert, or Phong. 

![mat](img/05/assign.png)

### Select faces (a component of an object)
- Select faces from RMB hot menu (component mode), and choose faces where you will assign the material.

--------------------------------------------------
## Save as an obj file with a material
- Select the object and go to File/Export Selection and from the Export Selection Option window, chose OBJexport as File Type and from the File Type Specific Options, turn on Materials. 

--------------------------------------------------
## Converting .obj to .x3d in Meshlab
- Go to File / Import mesh and import the obj file (the texture file will come by automatically) and go to File / Export Mesh as to export it as .x3d.


---------------------------------------------------
## Upload to Shapeways
- Create a .zip archive of the exported model, and all the required texture maps. Zip the individual files; and don't include any folders!
- Uploading the zipped archive is identical to a regular model upload. 

----------------------------------------------------
## Optional: sculpting the surface of the Möbius strip

- Sculpt a stamp

----------------------------------------	
## Assignment
- By Tuesday Oct 18th midnight, complete today's class works and upload your final color zip file to Shapeways, then upload a screenshot of it to Tumblr, 
	- Please name your file with your name and date. The Caption for Tumblr is: "a05 by your name and date".   

--------------
## Prepare for Next week's presentation

- Please upload your pdf to present to the [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7x8GrEkHm-Ld29JMmRCemtsWjQ?usp=sharing). Name your pdf as "yourLastnameFirstname".

	## Mid-term project consideration  
	### You need to prepare only your presentation. Do not 3D print yet.
	- **Mid-term project (individual): An arts research presentation at 6th week + first print + modeling data.**     
		- An arts research presentation: develop your own preferences and artistic direction regarding 3D fabrication.
		- Presentation format 
			- Length: Presentation needs to be done in 3 mins so around 3~5 pages including the front title page will be good.
			- What it needs to include: 
				- your research about an inspiring 3D fabrication artwork and artist.  
				- Keywords to show your object and subject direction in 3d fabrication.  
				- your sketch to show your concept 
				- your brief plan to achieve your goal
				- any kind of collaboration you expect to do
		- **This is postponed to later:**First 3D printing and its modeling data: applying the chainmail structure, build your 3D modeling and print it at approximately 2 inch (5 cm) size.  

- A survey to choose your group members next week.
