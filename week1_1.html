## Terms and definitions
- Sculpture: 3D construction
- Expansion: Spatial dynamics

## Conventional approach
### Sculpture: 3D construction
Reference: [Slideshare I](http://www.slideshare.net/chandelfino/sculpture-additivesubtractive-and), [Slideshare II](http://www.slideshare.net/shiveyb/introduction-to-sculpture)

#### DEFINITION
- A sculpture is a three-dimensional art object that can communicate abstract ideas, express an atmosphere, and evoke certain emotions.
- Sculpture is three-dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining hard materials, typically stone such as marble, metal, glass, or wood, or plastic materials such as clay, textiles, polymers and softer metals. The term has been extended to works including sound, text and light.

#### TYPES OF SCULPTURE 
- **Subtractive process**  
	Subtractive sculpture is the oldest form of sculpture and involves removing material, as in wood carving or stone sculpture, to create a finished work. Subtractive sculpture is by far the most technically difficult and due to the nature of the medium is the most restrictive in expression.
	
- **Additive process**   
	Additive sculpture describes all other forms of sculpture and the process most commonly used today. Simply put, additive sculpture is the process of creating sculpture by adding material to create the work.

#### WAYS TO CONSTRUCT
- **Carving** 
	Subtractive process: material is removed: mainly wood and stone (marble).
- **Modeling** 
	Additive process: material is added: clay, wax, plaster, paper-mache.	
- **Casting**
	Casting: a mold is used to form molten bronze (or other material) into a desired shape.
	
#### MORE WAYS TO CONSTRUCT	
- **Attachment**: welding, gluing, nailing materials together.
- **Assemblage**: assembling found objects in unique ways.  
- **Relief**: attached to a surface.  
- **Kinetic Sculpture**: movable parts (wind).

# Overview of the project

Biomorphic & geometric and spatial cell & unit form

- Previous class (pdf or folder)
- Reference artworks (pdf or folder)

## Class organization
- Organizing based on numbers of students, background, space, equipment, material availability.

### What to decide:
- An individual work or a group work for more efficient critique communication.
- Space & equipment use.
- Material use.
- Presentation or portfolio.


----------------------

# Practice
- Sketch your ideas.
- Discussion (Q&A).

## Assignment
- Create Tumblr account 
	- Then, upload your inspired works related to the class theme. 
	- Also, upload your draft ideas in writings or sketches related to what you want to achieve in this class. A short sentence or a paragraph is enough.
	- Please write down your name so that I can see who has uploaded. 
	
	Tumblr website is an another channel for the visual communication in our class.
- Prepare materials
	- Paper for construction (class offered).  
	- Cutting knife (class offered).   
	- Cutting mat (class offered). 
	- Ruler (class offered). 
	- Glue and masking tape (class offered).  
	- **Drawing book, pencil, and eraser.**
