The *dominant/subdominant* relationship can be very exciting, due not only to contrasts in character but to position as well. More often than not, the relationship is enhanced if the axes are not parallel. The *subordinate* makes the design more interesting by introducing a third visual element and axis. The subordinate should make the design more three-dimensional, complement the existing forms, and complete the unity of the design. 

### Rectilinear volumes
- Goal: create your best relations between three blocks.  
- Pre making:
	- Idea sketching.  
		- **Realising perspective view**  
		- 4 plane view (orthogonal: top, front, side..)  
	- Mockup making. 
		- Using clay to create a prototype
- Making:	
	- Creating three rectilinear boxes.
		- **Appreciate the qualities of contrasting shapes.** The volumes choose should vary in character as much as possible, and no two should have the same measurements. Learn to assess the volume of an element by eye, without measuring.  
		- **Establish relationships between the volumes by choosing *dominant, subdominant, and subordinate forms*.**  The dominant volume is the largest element, the most interesting and dramatic in character. It occupies the dominant position in the group.  
		- **Be aware of proportions: inherent, comparative, and overall.** The *inherent* proportions refers to the proportions within a form: length to width to thickness. The *comparative* proportions are the proportions of one form in relation to another. The *overall* proportion refers to the character or overall configuration of a group of forms.
		
		***"The difference between beautiful and ordinary form is the sensitivity of these proportions. It is an intangible but very real quality. Understanding it is one of the most valuable assets of a visual artist."***

## Mockup

In manufacturing and design, a mockup, or mock-up, is a scale or full-size model of a design or device, used for teaching, demonstration, design evaluation, promotion, and other purposes. A mockup is a prototype if it provides at least part of the functionality of a system and enables testing of a design. Mock-ups are used by designers mainly to acquire feedback from users. - wikipedia
